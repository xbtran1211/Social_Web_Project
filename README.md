## Social Web Analytics (Leverage of Spotify API to uncover insights on tracks and playlists)

This project was carried out during my last year at Western Sydney University. This a group project and our scope of research was to use Spotify API along with `spotifyr` library as the
primary tool for analysis. Our project objectives are as follow:

+ Clustering and classifing the tracks' genre based on their audio features (my part).
+ Examine if there is any linear relationship between a track's acousticness and its poplarity score.
+ Construct network graphs at illustrate collaboration between artists.
